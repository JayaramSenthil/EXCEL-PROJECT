Project Title:  Aspiring Gen Z Career Preferences Dashboard
Objective:

To analyze and visualize the career preferences, salary expectations, and company type interests of the Gen Z demographic using Excel-based tools for actionable insights.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Microsoft Excel

  * Pivot Tables
  * Pivot Charts
  * Slicers

Data Overview:
  The dataset contains survey responses from over 100,000 individuals (mostly Gen Z).
  It includes data on:

  * Preferred company sizes for employment
  * Expected monthly salary during the first 3 years of work
  * Demographic counts like gender and ZIP code

Dashboard Insights:

1. Preferred Company Size for Employment (Sheet1):
Shows how many individuals prefer different types of companies such as:
Mid-size companies (251 to 1000 employees) – most preferred
Corporations (3000+ employees)
Startups of different sizes
Large companies (1001 to 3000 employees)
This reveals Gen Z’s inclination toward flexible and growing companies over traditional large corporations.

2.Expected Monthly Salary (First 3 Years) (Sheet3):
Presents salary expectations categorized into ranges such as:

5K to 10K
11K to 15K
16K to 20K
21K to 25K
26K to 30K (highest responses)

This insight helps understand what salary range freshers are expecting during the early stages of their career.

3. Demographic Summary (Sheet2):
Shows total responses by:
ZIP Code: (Count: 99,233)
